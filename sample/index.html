        <p>Hello, this section isn't coming from another page on the site.</p>
        <p>It's a div that sits just below the button you clicked.</p>
        <p>When the page was loaded, the presence of the davidmodal class on this div caused our library to create the necessary
        modal elements and move this div into it to ensure it would appear as a modal.</p>
        <p>An event listener attached to the button is causing this to fade into view</p>
        <p>You can click the below button to fade this out of view or click on the x at the top-right</p>
        <p>You can confirm this section is being hidden, as opposed to being removed from the DOM, by changing the default
        text of the below text box and closing this modal. You'll see your modified text remains when you bring it back into view.</p>
        <textarea>Default Text</textarea>
